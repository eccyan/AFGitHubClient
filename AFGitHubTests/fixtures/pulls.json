    "body": "In testing the new cache_digest functionality of Rails 4 I ran across something that might not be a bug, but to me is unexpected behavior. Assume we have a model named Person that belongs to car with the touch functionality enabled.\r\n\r\n    car_1 = Car.create\r\n    car_2 = Car.create\r\n\r\n    person = Person.create :car_id => car_1.id\r\n\r\nAt this point car_1 gets touched as expected.\r\n\r\n    person.car = car_2\r\n    person.save\r\n\r\nAt this point car_2 gets touched as expected, but car_1 is not touched. This leads to a situation where car_1's cache will not be busted. I submit that it should.\r\n\r\nBasically when an object that belongs_to another object had a previous relationship. I think both should be touched.\r\n\r\nI don't mind writing the code for this behavior, but I wanted to get some feedback from everyone else to see if there was a reason this wasn't ever implemented, or something i'm not thinking of.\r\n\r\nThanks",

These are the AR objects with callbacks (they need to be updated as soon as something in the transaction occurs). \r\n\r\nAll other AR objects can be updated lazily by keeping a reference to a TransactionState object. If an AR object is inside a transaction, then the transaction will add its TransactionState to the AR object. When the user makes a call to some attribute on an AR object (which has no callbacks) associated with a transaction, the AR object will call the sync_with_transaction_state method and make sure it is up to date with the transaction. After it has synced with the transaction state, the AR object will return the attribute that was requested.\r\n\r\nMost of the logic in the changes are used to handle multiple transactions, in which case the AR object has to recursively follow parent pointers of TransactionState objects.

    "body": "There was a lot of churn in the ParamsParser while fixing CVE-2013-0156\r\nThis attempts to restore intended functionality as faithfully as can be\r\nfrom 3957d44 for JSON and e1a0d86 for XML.\r\n\r\nAlso added is a integration test RackInputRewindTest which checks to\r\nmake sure that ParamsParser rewinds rack.input for both cases.\r\n\r\nIn some cases request.body can be [rack.input](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb#L226), so if ParamsParser doesn't rewind it unexpected things can happen. See rails#8490\r\n\r\nI encountered this trying to get the better_errors gem working in Rails 4. \r\nI've created a test app here: https://github.com/ethansr/rack_input to show [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors/blob/master/lib/better_errors/middleware.rb#L113) failing because it expects the env['rack.input'] StringIO to be at its start.\r\n\r\nIf the app is working correctly a stack trace will appear on the right side. If it isn't then a strack trace similar to this: https://gist.github.com/4591803 will appear in the logs.\r\n\r\nI realize this is sensitive file to touch right now and would appreciate any feedback.
